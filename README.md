![DAKKA](/README_logo.png "necessary")

It's a mod with guns. The guns make everything easy - not Russian Overkill levels
of easy, but still pretty damn easy. Eventually, I'll change up the monsters to
fix this. Today's not that day.

***IMPORTANT:*** This mod is intended for Zandronum 3.0 and ZDoom 2.8.1. Ever
since GZDoom switched over to OpenAL, stereo sounds have been playing incredibly
wrong - downmixed to mono and *much* quieter - and since Dakka uses a mix of mono
sounds and stereo sounds, this will result in some weapons sounding much quieter
than they should. There is nothing I can do about this.

Any version at and before 0.06-alpha6-2 were made in the days of Zandronum 1.3.
ZDoom 2.5.0 and Zandronum 2.0 will run them without a hitch.

### FRESH FROM THIS REPO

Above the latest-commit bar, on the very right, there's a download icon.

Click that, choose ".ZIP" (or ".TAR.GZ" if you know you can open it), then unzip
the ZIP file into its own directory.

Go into the pk3/ directory, select everything in there, and zip it all up.
Change the extension of the new ZIP file to ".pk3", and you should be good to go.

If, in the ZIP you created, everything's still in the "pk3/" folder, you zipped
the folder, not its contents. Don't do that.



## COLORFUL HELL

This mod has outdated support for Colorful Hell - the latest version it supports
is version 85. In case you're still using that version, grab colorful\_dakka\_85.pk3
from the addons/ directory (protip: hit the "Raw" button), and load the mods in the order: 

- Any maps you're using
- Dakka
- colourfullHell85.pk3
- colorful\_dakka\_85.pk3

Note that Colorful Hell will *not* run in Zandronum 3.0. You will need QZDoom or 
GZDoom to play Dakka with Colorful Hell.

Obviously, since the support is outdated, expect it to be spotty with newer
versions of Colorful Hell. Also, I do not play games with Colorful Hell, so it's
not extensively playtested on top of that.

Right now, my priority is getting Dakka actually *finished*. Once that's done,
then I might start worrying about addons.



## Wait, why's it missing stuff?

... is it? Besides intentional removals and restructuring, everything should be
back in place now. Unless you actually used the dakka\_jumpmod or dakka\_rearm
CVars, it probably got removed to make way for something else.



## Which would be?

Going down the list:


### Rocket launcher

Replaced by the impaler, since it's more distinct than "the Doom rocket launcher
but better". Plus I've always wanted to make an automatic multi-barreled rocket
launcher, and *of course* I'm fulfilling that desire.


### Plasma rifle, channeler

Replaced by the plasma lance. I was always waffling on the plasma rifle, and while
the channeler was an impressive tech demo... it sounded like shit and looked out
of place. So in comes the plasma lance to solve both of those issues. The primary
fire is a more interesting take on the plasma rifle, and the alt-fire takes from
the channeler without stepping on the chaingun's toes.

Plus, it's a plasma nailgun, and who wouldn't want that?

  

... actually, I think that's it for things removed. Everything else should be
present. Check the changelog, it should be in there. If not, I dunno.



## Are you *ever* going to release this?

I'm trying man :(
