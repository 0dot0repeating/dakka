**For Zandronum 3.0, ZDoom 2.8.1, and GZDoom 2.1.1**

It's a mod with guns. The guns make everything easy - not Russian Overkill levels
of easy, but still pretty damn easy. Eventually, I'll change up the monsters to
fix this. Today's not that day.

Any version at and before 0.06-alpha6-2 were made in the days of Zandronum 1.3.
ZDoom 2.5.0 and Zandronum 2.0 will run them without a hitch.

Early OpenAL implementations in GZDoom will play stereo sounds incorrectly - if
the chaingun alt-fire sounds super muffled compared to its primary fire, that's
the bug. Either switch to one of the port versions above, or update to the latest
GZDoom.

## HOW TO GET A GIT BUILD

**[Visual instructions](http://jinotra.in/static/downloads/dakkaVids/how2dakkaGit.webm)**

Above the latest-commit bar, on the very right, there's a download icon.

Click that, choose ".ZIP", then unzip the ZIP file into its own directory.

Go into the pk3/ directory, select everything in there, and zip it all up.
Change the extension of the new ZIP file to ".pk3", and you should be good to go.

If, in the ZIP you created, everything's still in the "pk3/" folder, you zipped
the folder, not its contents. Don't do that.



## WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE 0.06?

The `CHANGELOG.txt` file will tell you in greater detail what's changed, but the
most important things:

- Dakkaguy's limp-wrist punching days are over. Instead, you can pummel your foes
  with an utterly ridiculous barrage of jabs, or cave their face in with a hook
  to the face that'd leave anyone reeling in pain, if not splattered all over the
  walls. Or give them a one-two-**THREE** to bust the skulls of both the poor sap
  in front of your fist, and all his buddies next to him.

- The minigun's flamethrower now properly sets things on fire! Focus it on a
  demon to cleanse his sinful presence, or sweep a crowd and wipe out all those
  pesky hitscanners within it!

- The rocket launcher has been dropped and replaced with the **IMPALER.**
  Originally in the BFG slot before I decided that was stupid, it's a triple
  barreled, fully automatic deliverer of explosive death. The primary fire is
  a 300RPM torrent of missiles, while the alt-fire... well, it impales enemies
  and carries them away. Then they explode. Because why shouldn't you be able
  to weaponize the demons themselves?

- The plasma rifle and channeler have been dropped in favor of the **LANCER.**
  Taking the best of both guns and combining it into one, you have a double-barreled
  demon busting machine that anyone can appreciate. Do you want to pepper your
  enemies with plasma nails, or do you want to charge up a lightning storm to
  roast everyone in front of you? Either way, the lancer has you covered.

- The berserk pickup, now vacant due to the minigun changing spots, is now occupied
  by the **VAMPIRE SPHERE.** Every kill you make grants you health, and the less
  health you have, the more health you get back. Strong encouragement to stay in
  the fight and keep killing demons, don't you think?

- [The HUD isn't ugly anymore!](https://imgur.com/a/VLIrg) Seriously, what was I
  *thinking* with those rounded corners and that awful alignment?
