# DAKKA

It's a mod with guns.



## Wait, why's it missing so much stuff?

Dakka's code got messy, and underlying systems changed enough that I decided
enough was enough. Rather than let it go the way of Samsara, I decided to nip
it in the bud and restructure everything, cleaning up extraneous code,
streamlining things, and so on and so forth.

## So what *is* in so far?

* Score system
* Pickup system, though not configured for Dakka yet
* Arc system, though unused right now due to the Channeler not being reimplemented
* HUD, though the color-changing parts of it are non-functional right now
* Tracer system, cleaned up and much better at respecting your pitch
* Fists and pistols

## How long's it gonna take to add all the shit back in?

All that was added back in within the span of three to four hours, so assuming
all goes well, not actually that long!


README to be expanded as I think of what to add in this damn thing.
