"Better Doom Weapons" -> Dakka 0.01
- Scrapped all the weapon code beside the fists, and redid it from scratch.

- The emphasis is now on speed of weaponry, and utility in all weapons.



0.01 -> 0.022
- Mainly bugfixes as far as I can remember, largely for online play.

- Chaingun grenades were constantly exploding online, and in general desyncing
    like a motherfucker.

- The SSG was broken for some reason. Forgot how.



0.022 -> 0.032
- SSG switched from "faster SSG" to "two shots before every reload". Alt-fire
    changed from dragon's breath to gyrojets.

- Chaingun grenades no longer remote detonated - instead, they shoot up and rain
    grenades down upon thine demons, to smite them justly and nobly.

- Rocket launcher alt-fire slowed down so that the primary fire has a reason to
    exist. Seriously, who ever used not-altfire?

- BFG primary fire went from BFG BALL THAT BARRELS THROUGH SHIT to GIANT GODDAMN
    BEAM THAT BARRELS THROUGH EVERYTHING AND TURNS THEM INTO LIQUID *DEAD*.



0.032 -> 0.04
- ROCKETS FUCKING EVERYWHERE. Double rockets from pickups because best.

- NEW AMMO TYPES SON. Chainguns and SSGs no longer magically use rockets.
    Grenades are no longer rockets. You still get tons of rockets anyway.

- SSG gets new sounds! Also, 'rolling' the fire buttons in primary fire now
    fires two primary blasts off, rather than primary -> alt.

- BFG beam now uses 80 cells, to balance out the fact that it's UNGODLY POWERFUL
    AND ONESHOTS CYBERDEMONS AND MAKES NUTS.WAD ITS BITCH.



0.04 -> 0.05fuckme (yes seriously)
- SCRAPPER SON. No longer do you have a shitty no-effort chainsaw. Now you have
    a gun that takes the casings and whatnot spent from other guns, and turns
    them into molten hunks of scrap and SHOOTS THEM BACK AT YOUR ENEMIES. Death
    fueling death. Can't really get more metal than that.

- dakka_cl_recoil is in. 0 is no recoil, 100 is full recoil, and it can go up to
    1000 for 10x recoil. It's pretty ridiculous.

- Fixed SSG fire rolling - now you can let off two shots almost instantaneously,
    and rolling on alt-fire actually works.

- SSG now takes time to reload when it's in your pockets. No reload cancelling,
    faggots. Use a different gun for those two seconds. Like a rocket launcher.

- BFG beam's damage radius narrowed massively. Now it no longer wrecks everything
    forever.

- BFG alt-fire now uses 8 cells.

- You can now play as other classes with Dakka. This is mostly for laughing at
    not-Dakka classes as you smear them with rocket launchers firing at the
    pistol fire rate.



0.05fuckme -> 0.06:

NEW STUFF:

- Score system! Not just for dick-measuring, but it also gets you boosts in-game!
    The manner in which you kill shit factors into how many points you get, too,
    not just the type of enemy you kill. And believe me, there are a *lot* of
    point modifiers. You'll have a hell of a time *not* getting them.

- Minigun! It's also a flamethrower! It's also comparable to the plasma rifle
    damage-wise! It replaces berserk.

- Channeler! Bringing you the most complicated mechanics in Dakka so far in a
    blue-hot chain lightning package!

- New HUD! Now you will always know exactly how much ammo you have, exactly what
    guns you have on you, and what armor type you have. Switch over to fullscreen
    and get a slimmed down version of the hud, with the bulky ammo bar reduced
    down to an Unreal-esque set of ammo bars, which is about as small as the
    Unreal HUD too.

- Bullet tracers! Oh my god so many bullet tracers. If you don't want them, use
    dakka_cl_notracers to turn them off. Ya filthy animal.


WEAPON BEHAVIOUR JUNK:

- A lot of weapons got their explosions updated so that within a certain radius,
    they do full damage. In effect, their single-target damage is unchanged
    (besides formerly odd cases like the plasma rifle, which did significantly
    less damage if you hit someone diagonally) while their crowd capabilities
    are buffed significantly.

- In light of this, the rocket launcher has had its raw damage nerfed. However,
    with the full damage radius and a 16-unit explosion radius increase, it's
    actually slightly more effective when fighting crowds now! You just can't
    oneshot an archvile with the alt-fire anymore. Sad day.

- Plasma rifle's primary fire has been nerfed down to 60 damage. Now that it
    can actually do that 60 damage reliably, it doesn't need to be buffed
    further just so imps die in one hit.

- Plasma rifle's alt-fire has been buffed up to 120 damage per shot. However,
    its damage radius is only 16 units as opposed to the plasma rifle's 32,
    so it's less effective on crowds. Yes, the plasma ball explosions actually
    do something, especially since both of them do full damage across the full
    explosion area.

- The BFG primary fire is down to 50 cells, and the beam is still fairly narrow.
    It's not a crowd killer as much as it is a single target killer. Use the alt-
    fire for crowds. Or the channeler. Or minigun. Or scrappers. Or goddamn
    anything. This is Dakka. Everything is good for crowds.

- The BFG alt fire has been brought down to 5 cells. Besides that, and adding a
    full damage radius, it's unchanged.

- The SSG can now fire off both shots in the exact same tic! Does this really
    change anything gameplay-wise? No, but it's really fucking loud.

- The shotgun has its base kickback doubled (at 200), and the SSG has had its
    base kickback nearly quadrupled (at 350)! Launch cacodemons across the map!

- The shotgun fires somewhat slower for both fire modes. It's still twice as
    fast as the Doom shotgun, so it's all good.

- Shotgun grenades have a smaller splash radius. This combined with the slowdown
    means you no longer get a rocket launcher with every shotgunner. Just a
    watered down rocket launcher.

- The delay going from primary to alt fire on the pistol(s) is
    ridiculously short now.

- The fist now does 30 damage on primary fire and 100 damage on alt-fire, since
    your berserk pack grew six barrels and a flamethrower.


AMMO STUFF:

- Ammo capacites across the board have changed.
    10mm rounds (pistols):  200 -> 250
    Shells:                  50 -> 100
    Shotgun grenades:        30 -> 20
    Gyro shells:             20 -> 40
    5mm rounds (chaingun):  400 -> 500

- Small shell pickups no longer give grenades. Shotguns still do, though.

- Cell packs now give flamer fuel in addition to cells.


MISC:

- dakka_scrapperstart is now a CVar. You will never guess what it does.

- sv_doubleammo no longer doubles the amount of scrap you get. Use scrapfactor
    for that.

- For some reason higher dakka_scrapfactor values lowered the amount of scrap
    you got? That's dumb. Higher means more scrap now. It goes up to 1000, as
    in you get 1000% the scrap you normally would.
