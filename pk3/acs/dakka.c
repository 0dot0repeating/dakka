// vv STUFF FOR DAKKA_SPAWN

// Temporary items. These are items that are given and taken every tic by the
//  spawn script (dakka_enter.h) and used to signal shit to DECORATE. There may,
//  however, be a one tic delay between when a condition related to a temporary
//  item changes and when you actually get the item, due to the nature of
//  scripts running in no particular order. So don't use this for stuff that
//  needs to be communicated instantly.
#include "dakka_tempitems.h"

// Used in dakka_enter.h. Stuff that runs once, when the player spawns for the
