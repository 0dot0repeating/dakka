        "And so I rip and tear, for I have seen the demons, and seen that they have huge guts.",
        "More mods should do this whole 'random pickup messages' thing. It's fun!",
        "There's nothing wrong with you that I can't fix... with my hands!",
        "Try not to pay attention to the giant tumors on his arms.",
        "Is this what the right to bear arms is about?",
        "Here comes the night train!",
        "Fists explode, right?",
        "You are already dead.",
        "Guns are for wusses.",

        "This thing would normally require two hands to hold. You dual wield them.",
        "Ow, ow, fuck! These casings are hot! Why am I doing this?!",
        "Oh my god this mod rips off Unreal Tournament so much.",
        "Wait until you see the weaponized pressure washers.",
        "What are you gonna do, give me some spare tin?",
        "Questionably legal. Unquestionably awesome.",
        "These sure are some funky-looking rivets.",
        "Where'd the second one come from?",
        "It turns ammo into more ammo!",

        "I still can't tell where the back and top of the slide actually meets on these things.",
        "You could probably beat the map with only these... but do you really want to?",
        "The pistol actually has three barrels. No, don't look down them!",
        "People actually put pistol pickups in their maps?",
        "Oh yeah. These things. The pistols. Right. Yeah.",
        "Just be glad it's not an assault rifle.",
        "Well, you gotta have them... I guess.",
    },

        "If you don't have any clay pigeons lying around, lost souls work too.",

        "For the refined, tasteful demon slayer. And everyone else.",
        "Why's the military using hunting shotguns, anyway?",
        "The long end goes towards the demons, by the way.",
        "It's never too early to blow everything up.",
        "Your shells don't also double as grenades?",
        "You got a club that can hold shells!",
        "You can probably find it at S-Mart.",
        "Don't blow your load too quickly.",
        "As opposed to what, a punchgun?",
    },
    { // SSG
        "Because nothing says 'fuck you' like four shells from a double-barreled shotgun.",
        "YES I KNOW THE DOUBLE-TAP MAKES NO SENSE IT'S A COOL GAME MECHANIC OKAY?",
        "Good thing I learned how to reload shotguns with my buttcheeks!",
        "It's a miracle those tiny rockets fit in the barrel at all.",
        "Even the shotguns have tiny teleporters in them!",
        "In town, you're the law. Out here, it's me.",
        "He also uses explosions to make smoothies.",
        "Hello, cacodemon! Goodbye, cacodemon!",
        "Wouldn't be a Doom mod without one.",

        "The grenades are launched by very tiny gnomes inside the barrels.",
        "For when you need to shave a demon from halfway across the map.",
        "Not pictured: the fifty pounds of ammo boxes you lug around.",
        "No, it's not technically a chaingun. No, no one cares.",
        "When are they gonna invent a gatling-gatling gun?",
        "So \cathis\c- is where the military budget goes.",
        "Just shove it into your chest. It'll be fine.",

    },
    { // Minigun
        "It's like a fire hose! Except it shoots fire. And there's six of them. And they're made of metal.",
        "Is \cayour\c- flashlight chambered for 5mm rounds? No? Didn't think so.",
        "Absolutely \cano\c- resemblance to any guns from Painkiller. No siree.",
        "I sure hope the map wasn't relying on you having 100 health now.",
        "There's a reason you can carry 1000 rounds for this.",
        "It doesn't even light enemies on fire. How shitty.",
        "It's probably \castill\c- not fast enough!",
        "It's legal! Probably. Who's asking?",
        "How serious? Very serious.",
        "Now go, and terminate.",
        "What's ammo?",
    },
    { // Impaler
        "If you ignore fire rate, this is totally weaker than the vanilla rocket launcher.",

        "You don't get to keep it if you keep making dick jokes about it.",
        "What's that? I can't hear you over these endless explosions!",
        "Would you believe this was once a pressure washer?",
        "Oh my god this mod rips off Duke Nukem 3D so much.",
        "And this is why you can hold up to 240 rockets.",
        "It's certainly one way to loosen a rusty bolt.",
        "The magazine for it is bigger than your head.",
        "Jesus christ this dumb thing is so heavy.",
        "You picked up a cartoony church organ!",

        "You see, when a marine and a ranger love each other very much...",
        "It was a good day when we taught electricity to only fry demons.",
        "Hey wait a second, this isn't a lance at all! I was lied to!",
        "If you think you're dodging this, you're in for a shock.",
        "Yeah just slap lights all over it, it's fine.",
        "The side grip makes it fire 50% faster.",
        "It's the nail for the demons' coffins.",
        "Zip, zap, zop! I'm gonna make you pop!",
        "What? Your nailgun is evolving!",
        "It's positively electrifying!",
        "Way to get a point across.",
    },

        "Honestly, it's amazing that the UAC even lost with guns like these.",
        "In case you haven't yet realized, this is not a deathmatch mod.",
        "Bringing you the most hated gun from Quake 3 in an alt-fire!",
        "Wasn't needing any of that \"difficulty\" stuff anyway.",
        "The beam is bigger than the gun because shut up.",
        "Everything's better with spinning. Even lasers.",
