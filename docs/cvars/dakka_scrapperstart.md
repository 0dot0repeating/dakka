## Description

`dakka_scrapperstart` is a simple [CVar](../cvars.md). If it's set to `true`,
any Dakkaguy that enters the game will be given Scrappers on spawn. No ammo is
given for them, however. 

If `dakka_startmode_ammo` is 1 or 2, the Scrappers will not be counted as a weapon
you have upon first spawn. It'll only count it in your inventory afterwards. Go
shoot some dudes for your scrap.
